# Findings

## Evidence Integrity Confirmation
All acquired and created artifacts maintained integrity throughout the examination process. Cryptographic hash values generated at multiple stages of the lab remained consistent across tools, confirming that no data alteration occurred during acquisition or validation.

Independent hash verification using HashCalc produced identical MD5 and SHA-1 values to those generated by FTK Imager, demonstrating tool reliability and reinforcing confidence in the evidence handling process.

## Environment Validation
The forensic workstation environment was verified prior to evidence acquisition. All connected storage devices were identified, and dedicated media were used exclusively for evidence storage and analysis. This separation minimized the risk of cross-contamination and ensured compliance with forensic handling best practices.

System configuration details, including operating system architecture and security posture, were documented to establish analytical context and support reproducibility.

## Artifact-Level Analysis
Individual validation artifacts, including the created text file, were hashed independently to confirm file-level integrity. Hash values remained unchanged following creation and review, indicating proper handling procedures and controlled access throughout the lab.

This step demonstrates the ability to verify integrity not only at the evidence container level but also at the individual artifact level—an essential practice in forensic investigations.

## Forensic Readiness Assessment
The procedures executed during this lab reflect foundational forensic readiness principles, including:
- Controlled examination environments
- Proper evidence segregation
- Cryptographic integrity validation
- Documentation sufficient to support audit and review

These findings confirm that the acquisition and validation process aligns with industry-accepted digital forensic standards and supports defensible evidence handling.
