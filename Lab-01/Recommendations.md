# Recommendations

## Evidence Handling and Preservation
- Continue to enforce strict separation between forensic workstations and evidence storage media to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.
- Maintain consistent documentation of connected devices and examination environments prior to evidence acquisition.
- Preserve original evidence in a read-only state and perform all analysis on verified copies.

---

## Integrity Verification Practices
- Use cryptographic hashing at multiple stages of evidence handling to validate integrity before, during, and after analysis.
- Perform cross-tool hash verification where possible to increase confidence in results and reduce tool dependency.
- Record all hash values in a centralized evidence log to support auditability and chain-of-custody requirements.

---

## Forensic Readiness Improvements
- Establish standardized forensic acquisition and validation procedures to ensure repeatability across investigations.
- Maintain updated forensic tools and utilities to support accurate file system identification and artifact analysis.
- Document system configurations used for analysis to support reproducibility and peer review.

## Operational Value
Applying consistent evidence handling, validation, and documentation practices strengthens investigative defensibility and supports downstream incident response, legal review, and compliance activities. These foundational controls improve organizational forensic readiness and reduce risk during security investigations.
