# Executive Summary – Lab 01 (Forensic Evidence Collection & Integrity)

## Summary
This case demonstrates foundational digital forensics workflow focused on **forensically sound evidence acquisition** and **integrity validation**. A Windows system was assessed in a controlled lab environment and relevant artifacts were collected using standard DFIR procedures. Evidence integrity was preserved through consistent documentation and cryptographic hashing to support repeatable verification.

## What Was Done
- Prepared an analysis environment to reduce contamination risk during collection  
- Collected targeted system artifacts relevant to baseline host validation  
- Generated and recorded cryptographic hashes (e.g., MD5/SHA) to confirm evidence integrity  
- Documented actions and outputs in a structured case format (evidence → analysis → findings → recommendations)

## Outcome
All collected artifacts were successfully preserved with integrity checks suitable for downstream forensic analysis, incident response workflows, or audit/legal review contexts. This lab reinforces the importance of **methodical acquisition, verification, and documentation** as the foundation of defensible digital investigations.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Evidence acquisition and preservation
- Hash-based integrity verification
- DFIR documentation and reporting structure
- Forensic workflow discipline (repeatability + defensibility)
