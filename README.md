# Forensic Evidence Collection and Integrity Validation

This project documents a digital forensics case study focused on **forensic evidence acquisition, integrity validation, and preservation**. The investigation demonstrates foundational DFIR methodology used to ensure that digital evidence is collected, analyzed, and maintained in a forensically sound manner.

## Project Overview

This repository presents a structured forensic workflow emphasizing evidence integrity from acquisition through analysis. The project highlights proper forensic handling procedures, cryptographic hash validation, and documentation practices aligned with industry standards for digital investigations.

The primary objective was to validate that evidence remained unaltered throughout the investigative process and to demonstrate professional evidence handling suitable for real-world DFIR and legal contexts.
