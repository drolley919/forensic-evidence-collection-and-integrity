## File System Identification and Initial Examination

The USB device was examined using FTK Imager to identify the underlying file system and validate structural integrity prior to deeper analysis. The evidence was recognized as a FAT32-formatted volume, and the boot sector was reviewed in both logical and hex views.

This step confirmed the file system type and ensured the media could be safely analyzed without modification.
