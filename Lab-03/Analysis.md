# Analysis

## Analytical Approach
The analysis focused on examining file system artifacts within the forensic image to identify relevant data, validate metadata consistency, and establish contextual understanding of stored content. Emphasis was placed on accurate interpretation of file attributes, timestamps, and directory structures to support defensible conclusions.

All analysis was performed on verified forensic copies to preserve original evidence integrity.

## File System Context
The disk image was examined to understand its underlying file system structure and organization. Directory layouts, file hierarchies, and metadata were reviewed to establish baseline context for artifact interpretation.

Understanding file system context is critical for differentiating user-generated content from system-generated artifacts and for identifying anomalies that may warrant deeper investigation.

## Artifact Examination
Recovered files and directories were examined to identify artifacts of potential investigative value. File attributes, including size, location, and timestamps, were reviewed to assess relevance and consistency.

Metadata analysis supported reconstruction of file activity by identifying creation, modification, and access patterns. These attributes were evaluated collectively rather than in isolation to reduce misinterpretation of normal system behavior.

## Timestamp and Metadata Interpretation
File timestamps were analyzed to provide temporal context around file activity. Timestamp values were reviewed with awareness of file system behavior and potential sources of variation, such as system processes or application interactions.

This analysis approach supports accurate interpretation of file activity while minimizing false assumptions based on individual timestamp values.

## Integrity and Validation Considerations
Throughout analysis, previously validated hash values and storage documentation were used to ensure that examined artifacts remained unchanged. Analysis outputs were reviewed in the context of verified evidence handling practices to maintain forensic defensibility.

## Analytical Assessment
The examined file system artifacts were consistent with expected structures and behaviors. No anomalies or inconsistencies were identified that would undermine the reliability of the analyzed data. Findings derived from this analysis are supported by validated evidence handling and disciplined examination methodology.
