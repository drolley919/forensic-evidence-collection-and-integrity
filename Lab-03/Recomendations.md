# Recommendations

## File System Analysis Practices
- Continue to apply structured file system analysis methodologies to ensure accurate interpretation of artifacts and metadata.
- Evaluate file attributes and timestamps collectively rather than in isolation to reduce the risk of misinterpretation.
- Maintain awareness of file system–specific behaviors that may influence timestamp values or metadata presentation.

---

## Evidence Handling and Validation
- Preserve original evidence in a read-only state and perform all analysis on verified forensic copies.
- Retain cryptographic hash values and storage documentation to support integrity validation and auditability.
- Document analysis environments and storage configurations consistently to ensure repeatability and defensibility.

---

## Investigative Context and Correlation
- Correlate file system artifacts with other data sources, such as system logs or user activity records, when available, to strengthen investigative conclusions.
- Avoid drawing conclusions based solely on individual artifacts without supporting contextual evidence.
- Use disciplined documentation practices to clearly separate observed facts from analytical interpretation.

## Operational Value
Consistent file system artifact analysis and disciplined documentation practices strengthen the reliability of forensic findings and support downstream incident response, compliance reviews, and internal investigations. Applying these recommendations improves investigative accuracy and reduces the risk of unsupported or incorrect conclusions.
