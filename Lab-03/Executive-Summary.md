# Executive Summary – Lab 03 (File System Artifact Analysis)

## Summary
This case documents a focused digital forensic examination of **file system artifacts** within a disk image to identify, interpret, and contextualize data relevant to an investigation. The objective was to analyze file structures, metadata, and timestamps to support defensible forensic conclusions.

---

## Scope of Analysis
The examination included analysis of directory structures, recovered files, and associated metadata within the forensic image. File attributes and timestamps were reviewed to establish context around file creation, modification, and access events. Industry-standard forensic tools were used to ensure accuracy and repeatability.

---

## Key Findings
Relevant file system artifacts were successfully identified and analyzed. Metadata and timestamp information provided insight into file activity and supported correlation across artifacts. No integrity issues or inconsistencies were observed that would undermine the reliability of the examined data.

---

## Risk Considerations
Misinterpretation of file system artifacts or incomplete analysis can lead to incorrect conclusions during investigations. This case reinforces the importance of disciplined artifact review, contextual interpretation, and proper documentation to reduce investigative risk.

---

## Outcome
The analysis demonstrates the ability to examine and interpret file system artifacts in a structured and defensible manner. Findings are suitable for use in incident response, internal investigations, or downstream forensic analysis requiring artifact-level context.
