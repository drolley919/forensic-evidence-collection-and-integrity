# Findings

## Evidence Integrity Confirmation
All examined artifacts and forensic images maintained integrity throughout the analysis process. Cryptographic hash values generated during acquisition and validation remained consistent, confirming that no alteration occurred prior to or during analysis.

Verified storage segregation and documentation further support the reliability of the examined evidence.

---

## File System Artifact Observations
Review of the file system revealed directory structures, file attributes, and metadata consistent with expected behavior for the examined environment. No irregular file system structures or inconsistencies were identified that would indicate corruption or improper handling.

Recovered files and directories were accessible and interpretable, supporting accurate artifact review and contextual analysis.

---

## Metadata and Timestamp Findings
File metadata and timestamps provided meaningful temporal context for examined artifacts. Creation, modification, and access times were consistent with normal file system activity and did not present anomalies requiring escalation or deeper forensic review.

Timestamp interpretation was conducted with awareness of file system behavior to avoid misattribution or over-interpretation of routine system actions.

---

## Validation and Consistency Assessment
Correlation between file system structures, metadata, and previously documented storage information demonstrated internal consistency across examined artifacts. No discrepancies were identified that would undermine confidence in the analytical results.

Cross-referencing artifacts within the verified forensic image supports defensible conclusions derived from the analysis.

---

## Overall Assessment
The file system artifacts examined during this case support reliable interpretation and reporting. Findings indicate that the evidence was acquired, preserved, and analyzed using disciplined forensic practices suitable for incident response, internal investigations, and downstream forensic workflows.
