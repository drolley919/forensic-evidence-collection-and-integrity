# Recommendations

## Forensic Acquisition Standards
- Standardize disk imaging procedures to ensure consistent evidence handling across investigations.
- Require full-disk and folder-level imaging when appropriate to balance completeness with investigative scope.
- Preserve original media in a read-only state and perform all analysis on verified forensic copies.

---

## Integrity Verification Practices
- Enforce cryptographic hash verification at multiple stages of evidence handling, including acquisition, validation, and post-analysis review.
- Use cross-tool hash verification to reduce reliance on a single forensic utility and increase confidence in results.
- Maintain a centralized record of hash values to support auditability and chain-of-custody documentation.

---

## Evidence Documentation and Traceability
- Generate and retain hash lists for acquired artifacts to support traceability and reporting accuracy.
- Validate analysis outputs, such as hash lists and reports, to ensure artifact-level integrity.
- Use standardized naming conventions and documentation formats to improve consistency across forensic cases.

## Operational and Investigative Value
Applying disciplined imaging, validation, and documentation practices strengthens the reliability of forensic findings and supports downstream incident response, legal review, and compliance activities. These controls reduce investigative risk and improve organizational readiness for handling digital evidence.
