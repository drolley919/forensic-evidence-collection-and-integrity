# Executive Summary – Lab 02 (Disk and File System Forensic Imaging)

## Summary
This case documents a foundational digital forensic investigation focused on the **acquisition, imaging, and integrity validation of digital storage media**. The objective was to demonstrate forensically sound acquisition techniques while preserving evidentiary integrity throughout the examination lifecycle.

---

## Scope of Analysis
The investigation included forensic imaging of **NTFS and FAT32 volumes**, verification of acquired images using **cryptographic hashing**, folder-level imaging, and generation of hash lists for captured artifacts. Industry-standard forensic tools, including **FTK Imager** and **HashCalc**, were used to ensure accuracy and repeatability.

---

## Key Findings
All forensic images were successfully created and verified. **MD5 and SHA-1 hash values matched before and after acquisition**, confirming that evidence integrity was maintained throughout the imaging and validation processes. No corruption, alteration, or acquisition errors were identified.

---

## Risk Considerations
Improper evidence handling or failure to validate forensic images can undermine investigations and compromise evidentiary admissibility. This case reinforces the importance of disciplined acquisition workflows and consistent integrity verification to reduce legal and investigative risk.

---

## Outcome
The imaging and validation procedures executed during this case align with industry-accepted digital forensic best practices. The results demonstrate the ability to acquire and validate storage media in a manner suitable for incident response, legal review, and downstream forensic analysis.
