## Folder Image Integrity Verification

A forensic image of a folder was created and verified using FTK Imager to confirm evidentiary integrity. Cryptographic hash values were automatically generated and compared during the verification process.

Both MD5 and SHA-1 hash values matched the reported values, confirming that the image was not altered during acquisition or validation.
